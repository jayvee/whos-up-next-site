## Modes

- **Drive mode**: `/aigon:feature-start <ID>` - Creates branch only, work in current directory
- **Fleet mode**: `/aigon:feature-start <ID> <agents...>` - Creates worktrees for parallel implementation

## Mandatory Lifecycle Commands

Feature and research work are NOT complete until you run these commands yourself:

1. `aigon agent-status implementing` — when you start coding or begin active research
2. `aigon agent-status submitted` — after committing all code, log updates, or research findings

These are CLI commands you run directly — not slash commands, not auto-invoked. The `aigon agent-status` command writes state to the **main repo** (not the worktree), so you won't see state files locally. Just run the command and trust the output.

## Critical Rules

1. **Read the spec first**: Always check `./docs/specs/features/03-in-progress/` before coding
2. **Work in isolation**: Drive mode uses branches, Fleet mode uses worktrees
3. **Conventional commits**: Use `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:` prefixes
4. **Complete properly**: Use `/aigon:feature-close <ID>` for Drive, `/aigon:feature-close <ID> cc` for Fleet
5. **Follow project instructions**: Check `AGENTS.md` for shared project build, test, and dependency commands
6. **Orient to the codebase first**: Read `docs/architecture.md` before making structural CLI changes

## Drive Mode Workflow

1. Run `/aigon:feature-start <ID>` to create branch and move spec
2. Run `/aigon:feature-do <ID>` to begin implementation
3. Read the spec in `./docs/specs/features/03-in-progress/feature-<ID>-*.md`
4. Implement the feature according to the spec
5. Test your changes and wait for user confirmation
6. Commit using conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`)
7. Update the implementation log in `./docs/specs/features/logs/`
8. **STOP** - Wait for user to approve before running `/aigon:feature-close <ID>`

## Fleet Mode Workflow

1. Run `/aigon:feature-start <ID> cc cx gg cu` to create worktrees for each agent
2. **STOP** - Tell the user to open the worktree in a separate session
3. In the worktree session:
   - Run `/aigon:feature-do <ID>`
   - Read the spec in `./docs/specs/features/03-in-progress/feature-<ID>-*.md`
   - Implement the feature
   - The `feature-do` command handles commit, log, and signaling completion — stay in the session for user review
4. Return to main repo for evaluation: `/aigon:feature-eval <ID>`
5. Merge winner: `/aigon:feature-close <ID> cx`
6. Clean up losers: `/aigon:feature-cleanup <ID> --push` (to save branches) or `/aigon:feature-cleanup <ID>` (to delete)

## Research Workflow

Research follows the same lifecycle shape as features: `start -> do -> submit -> eval -> close`.

### Drive Mode

1. Run `/aigon:research-start <ID>` to move the topic to in-progress
2. Run `/aigon:research-do <ID>` to conduct the research
3. Write findings directly in the main research document
4. Run `aigon agent-status submitted` when your research pass is complete
5. Run `/aigon:research-close <ID>` when ready to finish

### Fleet Mode

1. Run `/aigon:research-start <ID> cc cx gg cu` to prepare and launch parallel research
2. In each agent session, run `/aigon:research-do <ID>`
3. Each agent writes only to its own findings file and signals completion
4. Return to the main repo for synthesis: `/aigon:research-eval <ID>`
5. Finish the topic: `/aigon:research-close <ID>`
6. Use `/aigon:research-open <ID>` only to re-open or attach Fleet research sessions after setup


## Saving Permissions

When the user says "save that permission", "remember that", or asks you to persist a permission you were just granted:

1. Read `.claude/settings.json`
2. Add the tool pattern to the `permissions.allow` array
3. Write the updated file
4. Confirm what you saved

Use the narrowest pattern that covers the user's intent:
- Specific: `Bash(npm test)`, `Bash(git push:*)`
- Broad: `Bash(npm:*)`, `Bash(node:*)`

Prefer specific patterns — broad Bash allows can be chained to bypass deny rules. Ask the user if unsure whether to save narrowly or broadly.

## Before Completing a Feature

Before running `/aigon:feature-close`, always:

1. **Push the branch to origin** to save your work remotely:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <current-branch-name>
   ```
2. **Ask the user** if they want to delete the local branch after merge (the CLI will delete it by default)
