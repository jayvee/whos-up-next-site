## Commands

### Feature Commands (unified for Drive and Fleet modes)

| `/aigon:feature-close <ID> [agent]` | Merge and complete feature |
| `/aigon:feature-autopilot <ID> [agents...]` | Fleet autopilot: setup + spawn + monitor + eval |
| `/aigon:feature-cleanup <ID>` | Clean up Fleet worktrees and branches |

### Research Commands (unified for Drive and Fleet modes)
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|

| `/aigon:research-open <ID>` | Open all Fleet agents side-by-side for parallel research |
| `/aigon:research-do <ID>` | Conduct research (write findings) |
| `/aigon:research-submit` | (agent-only) Signal research findings complete |
| `/aigon:research-close <ID>` | Complete research topic |

### Feedback Commands
| Command | Description |

## Modes

- **Drive mode**: `/aigon:feature-setup <ID>` - Creates branch only, work in current directory
- **Fleet mode**: `/aigon:feature-setup <ID> <agents...>` - Creates worktrees for parallel implementation

## Critical Rules

1. **Read the spec first**: Always check `./docs/specs/features/03-in-progress/` before coding
2. **Work in isolation**: Drive mode uses branches, Fleet mode uses worktrees
3. **Conventional commits**: Use `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:` prefixes
4. **Complete properly**: Use `/aigon:feature-close <ID>` for Drive, `/aigon:feature-close <ID> cc` for Fleet
5. **Follow project instructions**: Check `AGENTS.md` for shared project build, test, and dependency commands
6. **Orient to the codebase first**: Read `docs/architecture.md` before making structural CLI changes

## Drive Mode Workflow

1. Run `/aigon:feature-setup <ID>` to create branch and move spec
2. Run `/aigon:feature-do <ID>` to begin implementation
3. Read the spec in `./docs/specs/features/03-in-progress/feature-<ID>-*.md`
4. Implement the feature according to the spec
5. Test your changes and wait for user confirmation
6. Commit using conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`)
7. Update the implementation log in `./docs/specs/features/logs/`
8. **STOP** - Wait for user to approve before running `/aigon:feature-close <ID>`

## Fleet Mode Workflow

1. Run `/aigon:feature-setup <ID> cc cx gg cu` to create worktrees for each agent
2. **STOP** - Tell the user to open the worktree in a separate session
3. In the worktree session:
   - Run `/aigon:feature-do <ID>`
   - Read the spec in `./docs/specs/features/03-in-progress/feature-<ID>-*.md`
   - Implement the feature
   - **STOP** - Do NOT commit or write log until user runs `/aigon:feature-submit`
4. Return to main repo for evaluation: `/aigon:feature-eval <ID>`
5. Merge winner: `/aigon:feature-close <ID> cx`
6. Clean up losers: `/aigon:feature-cleanup <ID> --push` (to save branches) or `/aigon:feature-cleanup <ID>` (to delete)


## Saving Permissions

When the user says "save that permission", "remember that", or asks you to persist a permission you were just granted:

1. Read `.claude/settings.json`
2. Add the tool pattern to the `permissions.allow` array
3. Write the updated file
4. Confirm what you saved

Use the narrowest pattern that covers the user's intent:
- Specific: `Bash(npm test)`, `Bash(git push:*)`
- Broad: `Bash(npm:*)`, `Bash(node:*)`

Prefer specific patterns — broad Bash allows can be chained to bypass deny rules. Ask the user if unsure whether to save narrowly or broadly.

## Before Completing a Feature

Before running `/aigon:feature-close`, always:

1. **Push the branch to origin** to save your work remotely:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <current-branch-name>
   ```
2. **Ask the user** if they want to delete the local branch after merge (the CLI will delete it by default)
