# aigon-research-close

Run this command followed by the Research ID.

```bash
aigon research-close {{args}}
```

## Argument Resolution

If no ID is provided, or the ID doesn't match an existing topic in evaluation or in progress:
1. List all files in `./docs/specs/research-topics/04-in-evaluation/` and `./docs/specs/research-topics/03-in-progress/` matching `research-*.md`
2. If a partial ID or name was given, filter to matches
3. Present the matching topics and ask the user to choose one

This moves the research topic from `04-in-evaluation/` (or `03-in-progress/`) to `05-done/`.

## Usage

**After evaluation:** Run after `research-eval` has completed — the standard parallel-work flow.

**Drive mode:** Run after `research-do` is complete and the research pass is ready to finish.

**Skipping eval:** Closing from in-progress (without running eval) will show a warning but proceed. This is most relevant for single-agent research, just as feature close can skip comparative evaluation when there is nothing to compare.
