# aigon-feature-do

Implement a feature. Works in Drive mode (branch), Drive mode (worktree) (parallel development), and Fleet mode (competition).

**IMPORTANT:** Run `/aigon:feature-setup <ID>` first to prepare your workspace.

## Argument Resolution

If no ID is provided, or the ID doesn't match an existing feature in progress:
1. List all files in `./docs/specs/features/03-in-progress/` matching `feature-*.md`
2. If a partial ID or name was given, filter to matches
3. Present the matching features and ask the user to choose one

## Step 1: Run the CLI command

This command detects whether you're in Drive or Fleet mode and provides guidance.

```bash
aigon feature-do {{args}}
```

To run in **Autopilot mode** — autonomous retry loop where a fresh agent session is spawned each iteration until validation passes:

```bash
aigon feature-do {{args}} --autonomous
```

Optional flags: `--max-iterations=N` (default 5) · `--agent=<id>` · `--dry-run`

> **What is autonomous mode?** The autonomous technique runs an agent in a loop: implement → validate → if fail, repeat with fresh context until success or max iterations. Named after the [original pattern by Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) and [similar implementations](https://github.com/minicodemonkey/chief) that treat autonomous iteration as the primary dev loop. Add a `## Validation` section to your feature spec to define feature-specific checks alongside project-level validation.

The command will:
- Detect your mode: Drive (branch), Drive worktree, or Fleet
- Display the spec location and log file
- Show implementation steps

**If the CLI fails with "Could not find feature in in-progress"** and you're in a worktree: the spec move was likely not committed before the worktree was created. Fix by running these commands from the worktree:
```bash
# Bring the spec into this worktree from the main branch
git checkout main -- docs/specs/features/03-in-progress/
git commit -m "chore: sync spec to worktree branch"
```
Then re-run `/aigon:feature-do {{args}}`.

## Step 2: Read the spec

Read the spec in `./docs/specs/features/03-in-progress/feature-{{args}}-*.md`

## Step 2.5: Consider Plan Mode

For non-trivial features, **use plan mode** before implementation to explore the codebase and design your approach:

**Use plan mode when**:
- Feature touches 3+ files
- Architectural decisions required (choosing between patterns, libraries, approaches)
- Multiple valid implementation approaches exist
- Complex acceptance criteria requiring coordination across components
- Unclear how to integrate with existing codebase

**Skip plan mode for**:
- **Worktree or Fleet mode** — there is no interactive user to approve plans; implement directly
- Single-file changes with obvious implementation
- Clear, detailed specifications with one straightforward approach
- Simple bug fixes or small tweaks
- Very specific user instructions with implementation details provided

**In plan mode, you should**:
- Explore the codebase thoroughly (Glob, Grep, Read existing files)
- Understand existing patterns and conventions
- Design your implementation approach
- Identify files that need changes
- Present your plan for user approval
- Exit plan mode when ready to implement

## Step 3: Implement and break into tasks from acceptance criteria

**Signal that you are starting implementation:**
```bash
aigon agent-status implementing
```

Before writing code, create a task for each **Acceptance Criterion** from the spec. This gives the user visibility into implementation progress via the task list.

Then implement the feature according to the spec. Mark tasks as in-progress when you start working on them, and completed when satisfied. If you discover sub-tasks during implementation, add them to the list.

### Agent Teams (optional)

For features with multiple independent acceptance criteria spanning different areas (e.g., frontend, backend, tests), consider creating an agent team. Assign each teammate a distinct slice of the implementation with clear file ownership boundaries to avoid conflicts. Use delegate mode and require plan approval before teammates begin implementing. Reference: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams


**For worktree modes (Drive worktree or Fleet):** Use relative paths throughout implementation. Maintain the worktree directory as your working directory.

## Step 3.5: Install dependencies (worktree only)

**Worktrees do not share `node_modules/` with the main repo.** Before running or testing, check if dependencies need to be installed:

```bash
# Check if node_modules exists
test -d node_modules && echo "Dependencies installed" || echo "Need to install dependencies"
```

If missing, install them using the project's package manager:
```bash
# Detect and run the appropriate install command
if [ -f "pnpm-lock.yaml" ]; then pnpm install
elif [ -f "yarn.lock" ]; then yarn install
elif [ -f "bun.lockb" ]; then bun install
elif [ -f "package-lock.json" ]; then npm install
elif [ -f "package.json" ]; then npm install
fi
```

> **Project-specific steps?** Check your root instructions file (e.g. AGENTS.md) for dependency commands.

## Step 3.8: Write tests for your implementation

**You MUST write tests for any new functionality you implement.** This is not optional. Test coverage is a key evaluation criterion in Fleet mode and a merge requirement.

- **Write unit tests** for new modules, functions, resolvers, and utilities
- **Write integration tests** for new UI components (render tests, interaction tests)
- **Add test cases** to existing test files when extending existing modules
- **Follow existing test patterns** — look at nearby `*.test.js`, `*.test.jsx`, or `*.test.ts` files for conventions (test runner, assertion style, mocking approach)
- **Run the test suite** to verify all tests pass (both new and existing)

> **Project-specific steps?** Check your root instructions file (e.g. AGENTS.md) for test commands and conventions.

## Step 4: Test your changes

### Drive Mode (branch)
- Start the dev server if needed
- Run the full test suite and verify all tests pass
- Ask the user to verify

### Worktree Mode (Drive worktree or Fleet)
- **NEVER run `npm run dev` or `next dev` directly** — this bypasses port allocation and will bind to port 3000 (the main app)
- Run `aigon dev-server start` — allocates your agent's unique port, starts the server, registers with the proxy, and waits for healthy
- Use the URL printed by the command (e.g. `http://cx-121.myapp.test`) — never use `http://localhost:3000`
- Use `aigon dev-server logs` to check startup output if anything seems wrong
- Ask the user to verify

> **Project-specific steps?** Check your root instructions file (e.g. AGENTS.md) for test commands.



### Before stopping: set up for manual review

1. Start the dev server (if not already running):
   ```bash
   aigon dev-server start
   ```
2. Open it in the browser:
   ```bash
   aigon dev-server open
   ```
3. Generate a **Manual Testing Checklist**: re-read the spec Acceptance Criteria and write a numbered list of concrete, human-executable steps to verify each one (e.g. "Navigate to /settings → fill in the form → click Save → verify the success message appears"). Present the checklist in your response before stopping.

## Step 5: Commit your implementation

**IMPORTANT: You MUST commit before proceeding.**

**Before committing, verify your working directory:**
```bash
pwd
```

Expected output:
- Drive mode (branch): Main repository path
- Worktree mode: `.../feature-{{args}}-<agent>-<description>`

**Now commit your changes:**
1. Stage and commit your code changes using conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`)
2. Verify the commit was successful by running `git log --oneline -1`

## Step 6: Update and commit the log

Find your implementation log:
- Drive mode (branch): `./docs/specs/features/logs/feature-{{args}}-*-log.md`
- Worktree mode: `./docs/specs/features/logs/feature-{{args}}-<agent>-*-log.md`

Update it with:
- Key decisions made during implementation
- Summary of the conversation between you and the user
- Any issues encountered and how they were resolved
- Your approach and rationale (for Fleet mode, helps evaluator compare)

**Then commit the log file.**

## Step 7: Signal completion

**THIS IS THE FINAL STEP. YOU MUST COMPLETE IT.**

After committing your code (Step 5) and log (Step 6), you MUST signal your status. Run this command now:

```bash
test -f .aigon/auto-submit && echo "AUTO_SUBMIT" || echo "MANUAL"
```

Then follow the matching section below.

---

### AUTO_SUBMIT → run `aigon agent-status submitted` and exit

You are running autonomously. Run this command immediately:
```bash
aigon agent-status submitted
```
This session is complete. Do not suggest follow-up commands.

---

### MANUAL + Drive Mode (branch) → run `aigon agent-status waiting` and stop

You are on a branch in the main repo. Run this command immediately:
```bash
aigon agent-status waiting
```
Then tell the user: "Implementation complete. Ready for your review."

**STOP and WAIT.** Do not proceed until the user responds. Do NOT run feature-close.

---

### MANUAL + Worktree (Drive worktree or Fleet) → run `aigon agent-status submitted` and stop

You are in a worktree. Run this command immediately:
```bash
aigon agent-status submitted
```
Then tell the user: "Implementation complete and submitted."

**STOP.** Do NOT run feature-close — that must be done from the main repo.

---

**If you are unsure which section applies, run `aigon agent-status waiting` — it is always safe.**

## Prompt Suggestion

**IMPORTANT:** End your final response with the suggested next command on its own line. This tells the user what to run next and enables prompt suggestions. Use the actual feature ID:

- **Drive mode:** `/aigon:feature-close <ID>`
- **Fleet / worktree:** `/aigon:feature-submit`
