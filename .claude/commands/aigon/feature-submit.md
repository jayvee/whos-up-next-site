description: Submit feature implementation - commit changes, write log, signal done

# aigon-feature-submit

Wrap up implementation in the current worktree or branch: commit all changes, write the implementation log, and signal readiness for evaluation.

**Use this after testing is complete** — replaces manually asking "commit your changes and write up your log".

**Options:** `--no-exit` — keep the agent session open after submitting (default: auto-exit in Fleet mode).

## Step 1: Detect feature context

```bash
aigon feature-do --info 2>/dev/null || true
```

If that fails, detect from the current branch name:
```bash
git branch --show-current
```

Extract the feature ID and agent code from the branch name (pattern: `feature-<ID>-<agent>-<description>`).

## Step 2: Stop the dev server

If a dev server is running in this session, stop it now:
```bash
aigon dev-server stop 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Commit implementation changes

**Before committing, verify your working directory:**
```bash
pwd
git status
```

Stage and commit all code changes using conventional commits:
1. Stage all modified and new files (excluding log files)
2. Create a commit with a meaningful `feat:` or `fix:` message summarizing the implementation
3. Verify the commit: `git log --oneline -1`

If there are no uncommitted changes, skip this step (changes may already be committed).

## Update the implementation log

Find the log file:
- Drive mode: `./docs/specs/features/logs/feature-<ID>-*-log.md`
- Worktree mode: `./docs/specs/features/logs/feature-<ID>-<agent>-*-log.md`

Update it with a thorough writeup:

### Plan
- The overall approach taken to implement the feature

### Progress
- What was implemented (reference specific files and components)
- What works and has been tested

### Decisions
- Key decisions made during implementation and their rationale
- Any trade-offs or alternatives considered
- Issues encountered and how they were resolved

**Commit the log writeup:**
```bash
git add docs/specs/features/logs/
git commit -m "docs: update implementation log for feature <ID>"
```

**Signal that implementation is submitted (updates the log file frontmatter):**
```bash
aigon agent-status submitted
```

**Commit the status update immediately:**
```bash
git add docs/specs/features/logs/
git commit -m "docs: mark feature <ID> submitted"
```

## Signal completion

**First, detect the mode by counting worktrees:**
```bash
git worktree list | grep -c "feature-<ID>-"
```

Replace `<ID>` with the actual feature ID (padded with leading zero if needed, e.g., "01").

**Then tell the user based on the mode:**

**If 2+ worktrees exist (Fleet Mode):**

> Implementation submitted ✅
>
> Changes committed and log written.
>
> **Next step for you:** Switch back to the main repo session and run `/aigon:feature-eval <ID>` from there to compare all implementations.

**If only 1 worktree exists (Drive Worktree Mode):**

> Implementation submitted ✅
>
> Changes committed and log written.
>
> **Next step for you:** Switch back to the main repo session and run `/aigon:feature-close <ID>` to merge your implementation.

**STOP here. Do NOT:**
- Run `aigon feature-close` from this worktree
- Run `aigon feature-eval` from this worktree
- Push to remote
- Start any new work

## Exit session

**Unless the user passed `--no-exit`**, close this agent session by killing the tmux pane. This is safe because all work has been committed.

```bash
# Brief delay so the completion message is visible, then exit the tmux session
(sleep 3 && tmux kill-session) &>/dev/null &
```

Run this command immediately after outputting the completion message above. Do not wait for user input.

**If `--no-exit` was passed**, skip the exit command and instead display:

> **This session is complete. Do not suggest any follow-up commands.**
