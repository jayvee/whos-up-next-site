# aigon-feature-start

Prepare your workspace to implement a feature in either Drive or Fleet mode.

**CRITICAL:** You MUST use the CLI command below to perform setup. Do NOT manually move spec files, create branches, or create worktrees — the CLI handles committing the spec move before creating worktrees, which is essential for worktree modes.

## Argument Resolution

If no ID is provided, or the ID doesn't match an existing feature in the backlog:
1. List all files in `./docs/specs/features/02-backlog/` matching `feature-*.md`
2. If a partial ID or name was given, filter to matches
3. Present the matching features and ask the user to choose one

## Step 1: Run the CLI command

**CRITICAL: Run EXACTLY the arguments the user provided. Do NOT add agents that weren't specified.** The mode is determined by what the user passes — if they only pass a feature ID, that means Drive mode (branch). Do not assume worktree mode based on prior conversation context.

```bash
# Drive mode (creates branch in current repo) — user passes only an ID
aigon feature-start {{args}}

# Drive worktree mode (creates worktree for parallel development) — user passes ID + agent
aigon feature-start {{args}} <agent>

# Fleet mode (multiple agents compete in separate worktrees) — user passes ID + 2+ agents
aigon feature-start {{args}} <agent1> <agent2> [agent3...]
```

The mode is determined automatically based on what the user provides:
- **No agents**: Drive mode - creates a git branch in the current repo
- **1 agent**: Drive worktree mode - creates a worktree for parallel development
- **2+ agents**: Fleet mode - creates worktrees for each agent to compete

The CLI will:
- Move the spec from `02-backlog` to `03-in-progress`
- **Commit the spec move** (so worktrees inherit it)
- Create branch or worktree(s)
- Create implementation log(s)
- Set up `.env.local` with agent-specific PORT (worktree modes)

**If the CLI reports any errors or warnings about committing the spec move, resolve them before proceeding.** Worktrees branch from HEAD — if the spec move isn't committed, the worktree won't have the spec in `03-in-progress` and `feature-do` will fail.

## Step 2: Confirm setup and next steps

`feature-start` creates the workspace AND opens agent terminals automatically. The agents are already running — there is no separate "open" step.

### Drive Mode (branch)

After the CLI completes, the agent is running `feature-do` in your current terminal. Wait for implementation to complete, then:
```bash
/aigon:feature-close <ID>
```

### Drive Worktree Mode

After the CLI completes, the agent terminal is already open and implementing. Wait for it to submit, then close from the main repo:
```bash
/aigon:feature-close <ID>
```

### Fleet Mode (competition)

After the CLI completes, all agent terminals are already open and implementing. Wait for all agents to submit, then evaluate:
```bash
/aigon:feature-eval <ID>
```

### Re-opening a crashed/ended session

If an agent session dies, use `feature-open` to re-attach:
```bash
/aigon:feature-open <ID>          # Re-open a Drive worktree agent
/aigon:feature-open <ID> cc       # Re-open a specific Fleet agent
```

## Important Notes

- **Drive mode**: You'll work in your current repository on the feature branch
- **Drive worktree mode**: You'll work in an isolated worktree — ideal for parallel development of multiple features
- **Fleet mode**: Multiple agents compete on the same feature in their own worktrees
- Worktrees are created in `../<repo>-worktrees/` to keep them grouped with the project
- Agents start automatically — no need to run `feature-open` after `feature-start`

## Prompt Suggestion

End your response with the suggested next command on its own line. This influences Claude Code's prompt suggestion (grey text). Use the actual ID and choose based on mode:

- **Drive mode (branch):** `/aigon:feature-close <ID>`
- **Drive worktree:** `/aigon:feature-close <ID>`
- **Fleet:** `/aigon:feature-eval <ID>`
