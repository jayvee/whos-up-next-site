# aigon-feature-done

Complete a feature by merging the implementation and cleaning up.

## Argument Resolution

If no ID is provided, or the ID doesn't match an existing feature:
1. List all files in `./docs/specs/features/03-in-progress/` and `./docs/specs/features/04-in-evaluation/` matching `feature-*.md`
2. If a partial ID or name was given, filter to matches
3. Present the matching features and ask the user to choose one

## Usage

### Solo mode (branch or worktree)
If you used `feature-setup {{args}}` or `feature-setup {{args}} <agent>`:
```bash
aigon feature-done {{args}}
```
The command auto-detects whether the feature uses a branch or a solo worktree.

### Arena mode
If you used `feature-setup {{args}} cc gg cx cu`:
```bash
aigon feature-done {{args}} <winning-agent>
```

Example: `aigon feature-done {{args}} cc` to merge Claude's implementation

### Arena mode with adoption
Merge the winner and print diffs from losing agents for selective adoption:
```bash
aigon feature-done {{args}} <winning-agent> --adopt <agents...|all>
```

Examples:
- `aigon feature-done {{args}} cc --adopt gg cu` — adopt from specific agents
- `aigon feature-done {{args}} cc --adopt all` — adopt from all losing agents

## What happens

### Solo Mode

1. Pushes the feature branch to origin (to save work remotely)
2. Switches to main/master branch
3. Merges the feature branch with `--no-ff`
4. Moves spec to `05-done/`
5. Moves implementation log to `logs/selected/`
6. Deletes the local feature branch
7. Commits the spec and log moves

### Arena Mode (without --adopt)

1. Pushes the winning agent's branch to origin
2. Switches to main/master branch
3. Merges the winning agent's branch with `--no-ff`
4. Moves spec to `05-done/`
5. Organizes logs:
   - Winning agent's log → `logs/selected/`
   - Other agents' logs → `logs/alternatives/`
6. Removes the winning agent's worktree
7. Deletes the winning agent's local branch
8. Commits the changes
9. Shows cleanup options for remaining worktrees/branches

### Arena Mode with Adoption

**CRITICAL SEQUENCING: When `--adopt` is used, do NOT delete any worktrees or branches for the adopted-from agents until adoption is complete.** The adopted agents' worktrees must remain accessible so you can read their code and cherry-pick changes.

**Order of operations:**

1. Push the winning agent's branch to origin
2. Switch to main/master branch
3. Merge the winning agent's branch with `--no-ff`
4. Move spec to `05-done/`, organize logs, commit
5. Remove only the **winning agent's** worktree and branch (its code is now on main)
6. **KEEP all adopted-from agents' worktrees and branches alive**
7. Review the evaluation's cross-pollination recommendations (in `docs/specs/features/evaluations/`)
8. **Read the actual source files** from the adopted agents' worktrees — do NOT rely only on diffs
9. Apply selected changes to main (cherry-pick files, copy code, adapt patterns)
10. Run tests to ensure adopted changes work with the winner's implementation
11. Commit the adopted improvements as a separate commit (e.g., `feat: adopt cc's ARIA patterns and layout constants`)
12. **Only after adoption is committed**, clean up the remaining worktrees and branches

**What to review and adopt:**
- Extra tests and edge case coverage
- Better error handling or validation
- Accessibility improvements (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation)
- Layout/styling refinements
- Documentation improvements (comments, docstrings)
- Edge case handling the winner missed
- Performance optimizations

**What NOT to adopt:**
- Architectural changes that conflict with the winner's approach
- Duplicate implementations of the same logic
- Code that contradicts the winner's design decisions

### Cleanup after Arena

After merging the winner (and completing adoption if applicable), clean up remaining worktrees:

```
/aigon:feature-cleanup {{args}}         # Delete locally
/aigon:feature-cleanup {{args}} --push  # Push to remote first
```

Use `--push` if you want to preserve the alternative implementations on the remote repository.

## Important Notes

- **Solo worktree**: The agent is auto-detected — no need to specify it
- **Arena mode**: The agent parameter is REQUIRED (e.g., `cc`, `gg`, `cx`, `cu`)
- **`--adopt`**: Only available in arena mode — requires a winning agent
- **Do NOT run from a worktree**: Always run from the main repository
- The command uses `--no-ff` merge to preserve feature history
- Alternative implementations are preserved in `logs/alternatives/` for future reference

## Suggest Next Action

After the command completes, check the pipeline and suggest the most useful next step:

1. If `--adopt` was used and diffs were printed, suggest the agent **review the diffs above and selectively apply valuable improvements** before cleanup. This is the highest priority next action.

2. If the feature used **arena mode** (without `--adopt`) and has remaining worktrees, suggest cleanup first:
   `/aigon:feature-cleanup <ID>`

3. Otherwise, check the pipeline:
   - List files in `./docs/specs/features/02-backlog/` matching `feature-*.md`
   - If features exist in **backlog**: suggest setting up the next one — `/aigon:feature-setup <next-ID>`
   - If backlog is empty, list files in `./docs/specs/features/01-inbox/` matching `feature-*.md`
   - If features exist in **inbox**: suggest prioritising — `/aigon:feature-prioritise`
   - If both are empty: let the user know the pipeline is clear

## Prompt Suggestion

End your response with the suggested next command on its own line. This influences Claude Code's prompt suggestion (grey text). Use the actual ID/name from the pipeline check above.
