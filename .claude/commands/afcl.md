# aigon-feature-close

Complete a feature by merging the implementation and cleaning up.

## Argument Resolution

If no ID is provided, or the ID doesn't match an existing feature:
1. List all files in `./docs/specs/features/03-in-progress/` and `./docs/specs/features/04-in-evaluation/` matching `feature-*.md`
2. If a partial ID or name was given, filter to matches
3. Present the matching features and ask the user to choose one

## Usage

### Drive mode (branch or worktree)
If you used `feature-start {{args}}` or `feature-start {{args}} <agent>`:
```bash
aigon feature-close {{args}}
```
The command auto-detects whether the feature uses a branch or a Drive worktree.

### Fleet mode
If you used `feature-start {{args}} cc gg cx cu`:
```bash
aigon feature-close {{args}} <winning-agent>
```

Example: `aigon feature-close {{args}} cc` to merge Claude's implementation

### Fleet mode with adoption
Merge the winner and print diffs from losing agents for selective adoption:
```bash
aigon feature-close {{args}} <winning-agent> --adopt <agents...|all>
```

Examples:
- `aigon feature-close {{args}} cc --adopt gg cu` — adopt from specific agents
- `aigon feature-close {{args}} cc --adopt all` — adopt from all losing agents

## What happens

### Drive Mode

1. If on the feature branch with uncommitted changes, auto-commits them (`feat: implementation for feature <ID>`)
2. Pushes the feature branch to origin (to save work remotely)
3. Switches to main/master branch
4. Merges the feature branch with `--no-ff`
5. Moves spec to `05-done/`
6. Moves implementation log to `logs/selected/`
7. Deletes the local feature branch
8. Commits the spec and log moves

### Fleet Mode (without --adopt)

1. Pushes the winning agent's branch to origin
2. Switches to main/master branch
3. Merges the winning agent's branch with `--no-ff`
4. Moves spec to `05-done/`
5. Organizes logs:
   - Winning agent's log → `logs/selected/`
   - Other agents' logs → `logs/alternatives/`
6. Removes the winning agent's worktree
7. Deletes the winning agent's local branch
8. Commits the changes
9. Shows cleanup options for remaining worktrees/branches

### Fleet Mode with Adoption

**CRITICAL SEQUENCING: When `--adopt` is used, do NOT delete any worktrees or branches for the adopted-from agents until adoption is complete.** The adopted agents' worktrees must remain accessible so you can read their code and cherry-pick changes.

**Phase 1 — Merge the winner (handled by CLI):**

1. Push the winning agent's branch to origin
2. Switch to main/master branch
3. Merge the winning agent's branch with `--no-ff`
4. Move spec to `05-done/`, organize logs, commit
5. Remove only the **winning agent's** worktree and branch (its code is now on main)
6. **KEEP all adopted-from agents' worktrees and branches alive**
7. Print the raw diffs from each adopted agent

**Phase 2 — Review and categorize (your job):**

After the CLI prints the adoption diffs, you must systematically review them. For each adopted agent:

1. Read the evaluation's cross-pollination recommendations in `docs/specs/features/evaluations/`
2. **Read the actual source files** from the adopted agent's worktree — do NOT rely only on diffs. Navigate to the worktree directory and read the files to understand context.
3. Categorize each change into one of these types:
   - **Tests** — new test cases, edge case coverage, test utilities
   - **Error handling** — try/catch blocks, validation, guard clauses, null checks
   - **Documentation** — comments, docstrings, README additions
   - **Edge cases** — boundary handling, defensive code the winner missed
   - **Other additive** — utility functions, constants, accessibility improvements, performance optimizations

4. For each change, decide: **adopt** or **skip**. Skip if it:
   - Conflicts with the winner's architecture or design decisions
   - Duplicates logic already present in the winner
   - Depends on code structure the winner didn't use
   - Would require significant refactoring to integrate

**Phase 3 — Apply adoptions:**

For each accepted change:

1. **Adapt** it to fit the winner's code on main:
   - Adjust file paths if the winner organized code differently
   - Update import paths to match the winner's module structure
   - Rename variables/functions to match the winner's naming conventions
   - Merge test cases into the winner's existing test files rather than creating parallel files
2. **Apply** the adapted change to the working tree on main
3. If a change cannot be cleanly adapted, skip it and note why

**Phase 4 — Verify:**

After all adoptions are applied, run the project's test suite. If tests fail:
- Diagnose whether the failure is caused by an adopted change
- Fix the adaptation or revert that specific adoption
- Re-run tests until green
- If no adoptions can be made to pass, revert all and note what was attempted

**Phase 5 — Commit (one commit per adopted agent):**

For each agent you adopted from, create a separate commit:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: adopt improvements from <agent> for feature <ID>

Adopted:
- <what was taken and why>

Skipped:
- <what was skipped and why>"
```

**Phase 6 — Cleanup:**

After all adoption commits are verified, clean up the adopted agents' worktrees:

```
/aigon:feature-cleanup {{args}}
```

### Cleanup after Fleet

After merging the winner (and completing adoption if applicable), clean up remaining worktrees:

```
/aigon:feature-cleanup {{args}}         # Delete locally
/aigon:feature-cleanup {{args}} --push  # Push to remote first
```

Use `--push` if you want to preserve the alternative implementations on the remote repository.

## Important Notes

- **Drive worktree**: The agent is auto-detected — no need to specify it
- **Fleet mode**: The agent parameter is REQUIRED (e.g., `cc`, `gg`, `cx`, `cu`)
- **`--adopt`**: Only available in Fleet mode — requires a winning agent
- **Do NOT run from a worktree**: Always run from the main repository
- The command uses `--no-ff` merge to preserve feature history
- Alternative implementations are preserved in `logs/alternatives/` for future reference
- **Drive mode auto-commit**: If you run `feature-close` while on the feature branch with uncommitted changes, the CLI auto-commits them before proceeding. This is the drive-mode equivalent of `feature-submit`.

## Update Documentation

After merging (and adoption if applicable), check whether the feature's changes require updates to project documentation.

1. Review the merged diff to understand what changed
2. Search the repo for existing documentation — look for `README.md`, architecture docs, API docs, design docs, guides, wikis, or any markdown files that describe the areas you just changed
3. Update any docs that reference affected areas — for example:
   - New public APIs or commands → update relevant reference docs
   - Changed behaviour or workflows → update guides or architecture docs
   - New config options or environment variables → document where appropriate
   - Removed or renamed features → remove stale references
4. Skip this step entirely if the feature was a purely internal refactor with no user-facing or architectural changes

If updates are needed, commit them as a separate commit:
```bash
git commit -m "docs: update documentation for feature <ID>"
```

If no docs need updating, skip this step.

## Suggest Next Action

After the command completes, check the pipeline and suggest the most useful next step:

1. If `--adopt` was used, the adoption should already be complete (Phase 2–6 above). If there are remaining non-adopted worktrees, suggest cleanup:
   `/aigon:feature-cleanup <ID>`

2. If the feature used **Fleet mode** (without `--adopt`) and has remaining worktrees, suggest cleanup:
   `/aigon:feature-cleanup <ID>`

3. Otherwise, check the pipeline:
   - List files in `./docs/specs/features/02-backlog/` matching `feature-*.md`
   - If features exist in **backlog**: suggest setting up the next one — `/aigon:feature-start <next-ID>`
   - If backlog is empty, list files in `./docs/specs/features/01-inbox/` matching `feature-*.md`
   - If features exist in **inbox**: suggest prioritising — `/aigon:feature-prioritise`
   - If both are empty: let the user know the pipeline is clear

## Prompt Suggestion

End your response with the suggested next command on its own line. This influences Claude Code's prompt suggestion (grey text). Use the actual ID/name from the pipeline check above.
