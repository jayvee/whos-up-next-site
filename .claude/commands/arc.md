# aigon-research-create

Run this command followed by the research topic name.

```bash
aigon research-create {{args}}
```

This creates a new research topic in `./docs/specs/research-topics/01-inbox/`.

## Important: Create the document only — do NOT conduct research

Your job is ONLY to create a research topic document. You are NOT researching, investigating, or answering questions. You are writing down what SHOULD be researched later by a different agent (or yourself in a later step).

**Do NOT:**
- Read source code to investigate the topic
- Search the web for answers
- Write findings, recommendations, or conclusions
- Fill in answers to the questions you define
- Explore the codebase beyond what's needed to phrase good questions

**Do:**
- Ask the user what they want to learn (if unclear from the topic name)
- Write a clear **Context** section explaining why this research matters
- Write focused **Questions to Answer** as a checklist (unchecked `- [ ]`)
- Define **Scope** (in scope / out of scope) to keep the research bounded
- Optionally note any **Inspiration** or starting-point references the user mentions

The output should be a short, well-structured document that frames the research — not the research itself. Think of it as a brief for another agent.

Next step: Once the topic is complete, run `/aigon:research-prioritise {{args}}` to assign an ID and move to backlog.

## Prompt Suggestion

End your response with the suggested next command on its own line. This influences Claude Code's prompt suggestion (grey text). Use the actual topic name:

`/aigon:research-prioritise <name>`
